# Google Play Store Data Analysis ðŸš€
This repository showcases the projects and skills developed during my internship as a Data Analyst Intern. The focus was on building a real-time Google Play Store data pipeline, performing data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, and creating an interactive web dashboard.

## Skills and Tools Used
- Python Basics: Writing efficient Python scripts for data analysis.
- NumPy: Handling numerical computations.
- Pandas: Data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation.
- Plotly: Interactive data visualization.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Basics of 'nltk' and 'NLP' for text analysis.
- Web Dashboards: Created dashboards using:
  - Tkinter: Desktop applications.
  - HTML/CSS: Web-based interactive dashboards.

## Project Overview
1. Real-time Data Collection:
   - Collected real-time data from the Google Play Store.
   - Managed and stored data in structured formats.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
   - Normalized data for analysis.

3. Data Transformation:
   - Aggregated and transformed data to uncover insights.
   - Feature engineering to improve data usability.

4. Visualization:
   - Built interactive visualizations using Plotly to analyze key metrics like app ratings, downloads, and reviews.

5. Natural Language Processing:
   - Analyzed customer reviews using 'nltk' for sentiment analysis.
   - Preprocessed text data (tokenization, stop word removal).

6. Dashboard Development:
   - Developed dashboards for data visualization and analysis.
   - Compared performance and usability of "Tkinter vs HTML" for creating user interfaces.

##  Key Outcomes
- Successfully created an end-to-end data pipeline and performed insightful analysis on the Google Play Store data.
- Built a comprehensive dashboard that provides an interactive experience for exploring insights.
